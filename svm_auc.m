function auc = svm_auc(Xtrain,Ttrain, Xtest,Ttest, doplot)
% The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) 
% against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. 
% The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or 
% probability of detection[2] in machine learning. The false-positive 
% rate is also known as the fall-out or probability of false alarm[2] 
% and can be calculated as (1 ? specificity)
